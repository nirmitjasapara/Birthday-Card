      <p>Happy Birthday Mummy,<br><br>
        Thank you for being the most wonderful mother a son could ask for. 
        Your unconditional love and support is the core backbone in our lives and keeps us 
        going no matter what problems we face. We love you so much and are lucky to have you as a mom, 
        because we honestly could not have asked for a better one. Thank you again
        for being so loving and caring and understanding and supportive. With a mother like you, 
        all our dreams not only become possible but we feel that they will one day come true.
        You inspire us daily with your actions and words, and the example that you have set for us by 
        leading such a tremendous life. So congratulations on 55 and here's to another 55!
        <br><br>Happy birthday with much love,<br>Nirmit and Arpit
      </p>
